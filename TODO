Shorten manifypods so it fits in < 200 character command line (like
pm_to_blib).

Rethink MM_Win32 tests.

Investigate one method per make target.

Test MM_Any and pull some redundant tests out of MM_*.t

Create a way to init MM objects.

Move instmodsh to utils/ in the core.

Handle config files (ie. /etc) and their special PREFIX needs
(ie. PREFIX=/usr, INSTALLCONFIGDIR=/etc).

Fix Win32 when perl is installed in C:\Program Files

Make sure PDL builds

Fix find_perl on Amiga trg@privat.utfors.se

Fix appending of .. when DIRS contains directories not immediately
below the cwd.

Fill in the IMPORTS docs.

Document "make install UNINST=1"

Remove tar -I Sun-ism from instmodsh.

find_perl has 2>&1-ism which will fail on Win95.

Consider adding a timeout option to prompt() and env variable.

Remove the dogmatic "always use h2xs" from the docs and replace with
something a bit more sensible.  References to ModuleMaker and perhaps
a small Makefile.PL tutorial.

Unify Win32->find_perl and VMS->find_perl

Remove maybe_command_in_dirs().

Consider if VMS->find_perl needs to have pieces put into maybe_command()

Replace non-working $safe_abs Win32->find_perl with "$abs".

Change find_perl's "require $version" and instead just print $].

Consider integrating Ed Avis's old find_perl fix that involves moving
STD* filehandles around.
